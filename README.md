# Data Science Projects
A collection of codes in R used in school projects

Instructions are provided as comments in code, with example parameters.  
Required packages are listed at the top of each codes, make sure they are installed before running anything.  

## Web-crawling with R
I have provided 2 methods to crawl with R, one using html package and the other using RSelenium package.

html package is faster but might not work with websites which use javascript to actively load its pages as you scroll down.
RSelenium package is slower but able to deal with the above issue by mimicking a browser.

### CY Burrple Crawl.R

### Tripadvisor RSelenium CY V2.R
Crawl comment and rating data from https://www.tripadvisor.com using RSelenium package in R
